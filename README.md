# DataStructures

Implementation of different data structures.

# Compilation and Execution

Run `make` inside of a subfolder for a given data structure. This will generate an executable inside of a `bin` subfolder that will run the tester code for that data structure (`main.cpp`)

The executable can also be built in debug mode which will print out logs to the console.
Run `make debug` to compile with these logging macros enabled

If you are recompiling, running `make clean` before `make` or `make debug` will clean out the last built binary and object files.
